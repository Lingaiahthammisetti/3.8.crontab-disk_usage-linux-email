ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a shell? What is a shell script?

Shell: A command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the OS using commands.

Shell Script: A file containing a series of shell commands. It automates tasks.

\#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"



ðŸ”¹ 2. How do you write and run a shell script?

Steps:

Create a file, e.g., myscript.sh

Add commands.

Make it executable: chmod +x myscript.sh

Run: ./myscript.sh



ðŸ”¹ 3. What is the difference between sh and bash?

sh is the original Bourne shell.

bash (Bourne Again SHell) is an enhanced version with more features.



ðŸ”¹ 4. How do you make a script executable?

chmod +x script.sh



ðŸ”¹ 5. How do you define a variable?

name="John"

echo "Hello, $name"



ðŸ”¹ 6. How do you read user input?

echo "Enter your name:"

read name

echo "Hi, $name!"



ðŸ”¹ 7. What's the difference between $var, ${var}, and "$var"?

$var and ${var} are usually equivalent. {} helps avoid ambiguity.

"$var" preserves whitespace and prevents word splitting.



ðŸ”¹ 8. Example of if statement:

num=10

if \[ $num -gt 5 ]; then

&nbsp;   echo "Greater than 5"

else

&nbsp;   echo "5 or less"

fi



ðŸ”¹ 9. case Statement

echo "Enter a number between 1 and 3:"

read num



case $num in

&nbsp; 1) echo "You chose One" ;;

&nbsp; 2) echo "You chose Two" ;;

&nbsp; 3) echo "You chose Three" ;;

&nbsp; \*) echo "Invalid choice" ;;

esac



ðŸ”¹ 10. Types of Loops

for loop:

for i in 1 2 3; do

&nbsp; echo "Number: $i"

done



while loop:

count=1

while \[ $count -le 3 ]; do

&nbsp; echo "Count: $count"

&nbsp; ((count++))

done



until loop:

count=1

until \[ $count -gt 3 ]; do

&nbsp; echo "Count: $count"

&nbsp; ((count++))

done



ðŸ”¹ 11. Number and String Comparison

Numbers:

a=5

b=10



if \[ $a -lt $b ]; then

&nbsp; echo "$a is less than $b"

fi

Strings:

str1="hello"

str2="world"



if \[ "$str1" != "$str2" ]; then

&nbsp; echo "Strings are different"

fi



ðŸ”¹ 12. Functions in Shell

greet() {

&nbsp; echo "Hello, $1"

}

greet "Alice"



ðŸ”¹ 13. Return Value from Functions

add() {

&nbsp; result=$(( $1 + $2 ))

&nbsp; return $result

}



add 3 4

echo "Sum is $?"  # $? contains return value

Note: Shell functions can only return numbers (0â€“255) directly. Use global vars for larger values.



ðŸ”¹ 14. Check if File Exists

file="myfile.txt"

if \[ -f "$file" ]; then

&nbsp; echo "$file exists"

else

&nbsp; echo "$file does not exist"

fi



ðŸ”¹ 15. Read File Line by Line

while IFS= read -r line; do

&nbsp; echo "$line"

done < file.txt



ðŸ”¹ 16. Check if Directory Exists

dir="/home/user/docs"

if \[ -d "$dir" ]; then

&nbsp; echo "Directory exists"

else

&nbsp; echo "Directory does not exist"

fi



ðŸ”¹ 17. Find Files Using find and grep

\# Find all .log files

find /var/log -name "\*.log"



\# Search for "error" in all .txt files

grep "error" \*.txt



ðŸ”¹ 18. Get Length of a String

str="Hello World"

echo "Length: ${#str}"  # Output: 11



ðŸ”¹ 19. Extract Substring

str="HelloWorld"

echo "${str:0:5}"  # Output: Hello



ðŸ”¹ 20. Split String

str="apple,banana,orange"

IFS=',' read -ra fruits <<< "$str"

for fruit in "${fruits\[@]}"; do

&nbsp; echo "$fruit"

done



ðŸ”¹ 21. Arrays in Bash

arr=("one" "two" "three")

echo "First element: ${arr\[0]}"

echo "All elements: ${arr\[@]}"



ðŸ”¹ 22. Exit Status

ls /tmp

echo $?  # Returns 0 if command was successful, else non-zero



ðŸ”¹ 23. Redirection Operators

command > file.txt    # stdout to file

command >> file.txt   # append stdout

command 2> error.txt  # stderr to file

command > out.txt 2>\&1  # both stdout and stderr



ðŸ”¹ 24. Pipes

ls -l | grep "^d"  # List directories only



ðŸ”¹ 25. Quoting in Shell

name="John"



echo "$name"     # Correct (preserves spaces, expands variable)

echo '$name'     # Prints: $name (no expansion)



ðŸ”¹ 26. Background Processes

sleep 60 \&

echo "Background PID: $!"



ðŸ”¹ 27. Get PID of a Process

pidof bash

Or:

ps aux | grep process\_name



ðŸ”¹ 28. Cron Jobs (Automation)

To open crontab editor:

crontab -e

Example job: Run backup script every day at 2 AM:



0 2 \* \* \* /home/user/backup.sh



ðŸ”¹ 29. Script to Backup a Directory

\#!/bin/bash

src="/home/user/documents"

dest="/home/user/backup\_$(date +%F).tar.gz"



tar -czf "$dest" "$src"

echo "Backup created at $dest"



ðŸ”¹ 30. Disk Usage Monitor Script

\#!/bin/bash

usage=$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')



if \[ $usage -gt 80 ]; then

&nbsp; echo "Disk usage is above 80%!"

else

&nbsp; echo "Disk usage is normal."

fi



ðŸ”¹ 31. Count Lines, Words, Characters in a File

\#!/bin/bash

file="sample.txt"

wc "$file"



ðŸ”¹ 32. Find Duplicate Files in a Directory

\#!/bin/bash

find . -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -d --check-chars=32



ðŸ”¹ 33. Error Handling with set

\#!/bin/bash

set -e  # Exit on error

cp file1.txt file2.txt

echo "Copy successful"

Add trap for custom error messages:



trap 'echo "An error occurred."' ERR
